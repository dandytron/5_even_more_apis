Homework for Columbia Unviersity's Lede Program.

# 5: Even More APIs

## This is the fifth homework assignment for Lede Program 2025.

### It's three Jupyter notebooks: 

1. The first explores Geocoding and Google Maps APIs
2. The second explores weird and sophisticated weather service APIs
3. The third explores last.fm music json objects

This assignment was meant to get us familiar with APIs generally:

- Geocoding
- Intaking JSON
- Pagination of GET request results
- ...and much more!

To view these documents, you'll need to use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or later recommended).

2. Install Jupyter and other required libtaries: Open your command prompt or terminal and run:

`pip install notebook jupyterlab pandas matplotlib altair`


### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: In your terminal, type:

`jupyter notebook`

2. This will open a browser window showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard where you can create or open notebooks.

### Option 2: Jupyter Lab (Alternative)

1. Launch Jupyter Lab: In your terminal, type:

`jupyter lab`

2. This opens Jupyter Lab, a more advanced interface that includes notebooks, file browser, terminals, and other tools in a flexible layout.

### Using Either Interface

- Option 1: From the menu, select Cell → Run All
- Option 2: Press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Enter (or Cmd+Alt+Enter on Mac)
- Option 3: Click the "Fast Forward" button (▶▶) in the toolbar if available

Then, wait for execution to complete.

Cells are executed in sequence. A number in brackets [1] appears next to each cell when it completes.

After that, scroll through the notebook and behold my struggles.

Happy viewing!
